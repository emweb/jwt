<h1>Release notes</h1>

This page lists important notes on migrating existing applications to
newer version of Wt. It lists changes in the library that may break
the way you build Wt, the way you configure Wt or the Wt API and
behaviour.

<h2>Release 3.2.2-rc2 (July 16, 2012)</h2>

<p>
  This release contains next to the usual bug fixes, the addition of new
  functionality for authentication.
</p>

<h3>A) Main improvements:</h3>

<dl>
  <dt>
    <a href="eu/webtoolkit/jwt/WLayout.html">WBoxLayout, WGridLayout</a>
  </dt>
  <dd>
    <p>
    The layout managers have been reimplement, to address various
    issues with the old implementation, including API (in particular the wonked
    side-effects of AlignTop, AlignJustify) inconsistencies and bugs.
    </p>

    <p>The new implementation no longer uses tables when JavaScript
    is available, but instead using JavaScript-based layout with
    absolute positioning. The table-based implementation is still kept
    for plain HTML sessions (and progressive bootstrap). The code now
    uses exactly the same layout logic for both horizontal and
    vertical layout (but giving precedence to horizontal layout) and
    should be much more consistent (and perhaps also more
    performant). However, because of the many complexities and
    problems with the old code (inconsistent behaviour), you may see
    issues while upgrading. Please see the "Non-backwards compatible
    changes" below for hints on how to deal with this.</p>
  </dd>

  <dt>
    <a href="eu/webtoolkit/jwt/WAbstractItemView.html">WAbstractItemView</a>
  </dt>
  <dd>
    <p>
    A drag &amp; drop mime-type can now be specified on a per-item
    basis using a new ItemDataRole,
    and the mime-type for the entire selection is computed
    from these individual mime-types.
    </p>
  </dd>

  <dt>
    <a href="eu/webtoolkit/jwt/WInteractWidget.html">WInteractWidget</a>
  </dt>
  <dd>
    <p>
    A new method setMouseOverDelay() allows to specify a delay for
    generating the mouseWentOver() event.
    </p>
  </dd>

  <dt>
    <a href="eu/webtoolkit/jwt/auth/AbstractUserDatabase.html">auth.AbstractUserDatabase</a>
  </dt>
  <dd>
    <p>
    A new method deleteUser() was added, which deletes a user and all
    related authentication information.
    </p>
  </dd>

  <dt>
    <a href="eu/webtoolkit/jwt/chart/WCartesianChart.html">chart.WCartesianChart</a>
  </dt>
  <dd>
    <p>
    A new method setAxisPadding() was added, which configures the
    amount of adding between the chart area and the axes.
    </p>
  </dd>

  <dt>
    <a href="eu/webtoolkit/jwt/chart/WDataSeries.html">chart.WDataSeries</a>
  </dt>
  <dd>
    <p>
    A new method setCustomMarker() was added which allows the use of a
    user-defined path for the markers. A new role
    MarkserScaleFactorRole was added which allows overriding the
    marker size based on item model data.
    </p>
  </dd>

</dl>

<h3>B) Non-backwards compatible changes</h3>

<dl>
  <dt>
    <a href="eu/webtoolkit/jwt/WLayout.html">WBoxLayout, WGridLayout</a>
  </dt>
  <dd>
    While migrating old code to this version, here are some tips:
    <ol>
      <li><p>Alignment flags</p>
      <p>Previously, specifying an alignment for a widget in a
      layout, or for the layout when set to a container, had a double
      meaning. Not only would it implement the given alignment but also
      revert to passively letting HTML layout decide the layout of the
      contents, and adjust the parent (layout respectively container)
      accordingly. This had all kinds of side effects such as not
      propagating the size of layout-size-aware widgets and quirks in
      the vertical alignment.</p>
      <p>WContainerWidget.setLayout(layout, alignment) has been
      deprecated and will be removed from a future release. This call
      was almost always used to let the parent container resize to fit
      the size of the contained children, instead of fitting children
      in the parent container. This behaviour is now
      automatically deduced based on an (empty) size of the parent
      container. In case this heuristic does not work, then setting a
      non-0 maximum size on the container using setMaximumSize() will
      act as a trigger, with the added benefit that the parent will only
      be allowed to resize up to a specified maximum size.</p>
      <p>An alignment specified in
      W(Box/Grid)Layout::addWidget(widget, stretch, alignment) now
      purely affects the alignment but has no other side effects. The
      perferred and minimum sizes of a child widget or layout is now
      always taken into account.</p>
      </li>
      <li><p>Child item sizes</p>
      <p>The layout algorithm is now implemented entirely in
      JavaScript, and is more gentle when dealing with a combination
      of cells (or columns/rows) that have a stretch factor and others
      that don't. Previously, a minimum (or fixed) size would be used
      to layout items that do not have a stretch factor. This had for
      example as a consequence that a WText would be narrowed down to its
      minimum width by using word wrapping throughout. Now, the
      preferred size is used for a child item, and shrinking to a minimum
      size only if necessary.</p>
      <li><p>Progressive bootstrap</p>
      A layout in the first page of an application rendered using
      progressive bootstrap will no longer fully upgrade to a full
      JavaScript version, but will result in a hybrid (between
      table-based and JavaScript-based). If it doesn't work out as you'ld
      expect, then you should reconsider the use of progressive bootstrap,
      or the use of a layout manager in your first page.
      </li>
    </ol>

<h2>Release 3.2.1 (March 30, 2012)</h2>

<p>
  This release contains next to the usual bug fixes, the addition of new
  functionality for authentication.
</p>

<h3>A) New classes:</h3>

<dl>
  <dt>
    <a href="eu/webtoolkit/jwt/auth/package-summary.html">eu.webtoolkit.jwt.auth</a>
  </dt>
  <dd>
    <div>This namespace contains model and view classes for
      authentication. It implements password authentication using best
      practices, email verifiation, remember-me tokens, and provisions
      support for federated login with an implementation of OAuth 2.0
      for authentication using third party identity providers.</div>

    <div>This package has been isolated in a separate jar (jwt-auth.jar)
      because it has several third-party dependencies (see below).</div>
  </dd>

  <dt>
    <a href="eu/webtoolkit/jwt/WFormModel.html">WFormModel</a>
  </dt>
  <dd>
    A model class for forms. These models are used in Wt::Auth as the
    basis for RegistrationModel and AuthModel, and allow a more
    straight-forward customization of the underlying behavior of these
    forms.
  </dd>

  <dt>
    <a href="eu/webtoolkit/jwt/WReadOnlyProxyModel.html">WReadOnlyProxyModel</a>
  </dt>
  <dd>
    A proxy model class which allows to share a source model read-only
    between multiple sessions.
  </dd>

  <dt>
    <a href="eu/webtoolkit/jwt/WTemplateFormView.html">WTemplateFormView</a>
  </dt>
  <dd>
    A WTemplate-based standard view implementation that works in conjunction
    with WFormModel.
  </dd>

  <dt>
    <a href="eu/webtoolkit/jwt/Utils.html">Utils</a>
  </dt>
  <dd>
    This class contains a number of utility functions that we found
    useful in projects using JWt, and were used internally in JWt
    already. They relate mostly to lower-level encoding and decoding
    functions: base64-, hex-, html-, and url-encoding/decoding.
  </dd>
</dl>

<h3>B) Main improvements:</h3>

<dl>
  <dt>
    <a href="eu/webtoolkit/jwt/chart/WAxis.html">chart.WAxis</a>
  </dt>
  <dd>
    DateScale and DateTimeScale axes have improved auto-configuration of
    limits and timesteps, now taking into account the resolution.
  </dd>

<h3>C) Build/dependencies</h3>

The auth package has been isolated in a separate jar file because it
has different dependencies.
