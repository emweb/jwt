<h1>Release notes</h1>

This page lists important notes on migrating existing applications to
newer version of Wt. It lists changes in the library that may break
the way you build Wt, the way you configure Wt or the Wt API and
behaviour. It also indicates the main changes from version to verison.

<h2>Release 3.3.2 (February, 2013)</h2>

<p>
 This release brings a few big new features, as well the usual
 small improvements and bug fixes.
</p>

<h3>A) New classes:</h3>

<dl>
  <dt>
    <a href="eu/webtoolkit/jwt/WGLWidget.html">WGLWidget</a>
  </dt>
  <dd>
    WGLWidget provides support for 3D graphics. It provides a single
    API to either client-side WebGL or server-side OpenGL rendering,
    all hardware-accelerated. For server-side support, you will need
    to get and install the applicable Jogl JNI libraries for your system.
  </dd>

  <dt>
    <a
    href="eu/webtoolkit/jwt/chart/WCartesian3DChart.html">3D Charts
    (WCartesian3DChart, ...)
    </a>
  </dt>
  <dd>
    A 3D charting library was added, based on WGLWidget, and
    integrated with the existing 2D charting framework.
  </dd>
</dl>

<h3>B) Main improvements:</h3>

<dl>
  <dt>
    <a href="eu/webtoolkit/jwt/WBootstrapTheme.html">WBootstrapTheme</a>
  </dt>
  <dd>
    Support for bootstrap version 3 was added, so now you have the
    choice between bootstrap version 2 or 3. Needless to say, you
    should probably target version 3 for new development work if you
    can live with its restricted browser support.
  </dd>

<h3>C) Non-backwards compatible changes</h3>

<dl>
  <dt>
    <a href="eu/webtoolkit/jwt/WDatePicker.html">WDatePicker, WDateEdit</a>
  </dt>
  <dd>
    The date pickers will now default to interpreting a single click
    as a date selection and also closing the calendar.
  </dd>
</dl>

<hr>

<h2>Release 3.3.1 (October 15, 2013)</h2>

<p>
 This release has a focus on bug fixes and other cleanups after the big
 changes that went into 3.3.0.
</p>

<h3>A) Main improvements:</h3>

<dl>
  <dt>
    <a href="eu/webtoolkit/jwt/WComboBox.html">WComboBox</a>
  </dt>
  <dd>
    The combo box now interprets LevelRole data to display headers
    (using HTML &lt;optgroup&lt; elements). Another improvement is
    that now the combobox saves its single selection while the model
    is updated.
  </dd>

  <dt>
    <a href="eu/webtoolkit/jwt/WDialog.html">WDialog</a>
  </dt>
  <dd>
    Modal dialogs can now be created and destroyed in any order
    without confusing the 'silk screen'. We now also consistently
    interpret an enter press in the dialog to invoke the default
    button added to the dialog footer (if there is one).
  </dd>

  <dt>
    <a href="eu/webtoolkit/jwt/WMessageBox.html">WMessageBox</a>
  </dt>
  <dd>
    Several improvements include the ability to indicate what buttons
    are the default and escape buttons with setDefaultButton() or
    button.setDefault() and setEscapeButton(), and the (long overdue)
    implementation of icons!
  </dd>

  <dt>
    <a href="eu/webtoolkit/jwt/WTextEdit.html">WTextEdit</a>
  </dt>
  <dd>
    We've added support for TinyMCE 4.
  </dd>

  <dt>
  <dt>
    <a href="eu/webtoolkit/jwt/render/package-summary.html">Render library</a>
  </dt>
  <dd>
    We've added a CSS style sheet parser which will parse and apply
    style rules in &lt;style&gt; blocks (or loaded through the API),
    and expanded CSS support to much improvemed table rendering
    (including border-collapse border model and repeated table
    headers), relative/absolute positioning, and page-break-before/after
    support.
  </dd>

<h3>B) Non-backwards compatible changes</h3>

<dl>
  <dt>
    <a href="eu/webtoolkit/jwt/WMessageBox.html">WMessageBox</a>
  </dt>
  <dd>
    The getButtons() method has been renamed to getStandardButtons(), and
    getButtons() now return the actual list of added buttons.
  </dd>
</dl>
<hr>

<h2>Release 3.3.0 (April 8, 2013)</h2>

<p>
 This release focusses on a reorganization of JWt's theme
 infrastructure, with the objective of
 supporting <a href="http://twitter.github.com/bootstrap/">Twitter's
 Bootstrap CSS framework</a> as a new theme. At the same time we've
 added a number of widgets for which Twitter Bootstrap provides
 styling.
</p>

<p>It is our intention to support the Bootstrap theme (or more
 specifically, the Bootstrap class names) alongside the themes we
 already supported (which are based on our own class names). Ignoring
 what Bootstrap brings, you should be able to upgrade to this release
 without too much trouble, although you may need to adapt some CSS
 stylesheets as we did reorganize a number of things which were
 required for Bootstrap and were a good idea for our own CSS
 stlesheets too.</p>

<h3>A) New classes:</h3>

<dl>
  <dt>
    <a href="eu/webtoolkit/jwt/WTheme.html">WTheme</a>,
    <a href="eu/webtoolkit/jwt/WCssTheme.html">WCssTheme</a>,
    <a href="eu/webtoolkit/jwt/WBootstrapTheme.html">WBootstrapTheme</a>,
  </dt>
  <dd>
    Theme support classes for JWt. The role of a theme is to:
    <ul>
      <li>Load the CSS stylesheets for a new session</li>
      <li>Annotate newly created widgets with appropriate style
      classes</li>
    </ul>
  </dd>

  <dt>
    <a href="eu/webtoolkit/jwt/WDateEdit.html">WDateEdit</a>
  </dt>
  <dd>
    Functionally almost the same as a WDatePicker, this class
    specializes WLineEdit and is thus a WFormWidget, making it much
    easier to use in WTemplateFormView.
  </dd>

  <dt>
    <a href="eu/webtoolkit/jwt/WNavigationBar.html">WNavigationBar</a>
  </dt>
  <dd>
    A navigation bar styles a menu as a typical top-level bar
    (currently only styled in the Bootstrap Theme).
  </dd>

  <dt>
    <a href="eu/webtoolkit/jwt/WPopupWidget.html">WPopupWidget</a>
  </dt>
  <dd>
    A base class to simplify the creation of popup widgets that
    typically assist in editing or provide circumstancial information
    for another widget.
  </dd>

  <dt>
    <a href="eu/webtoolkit/jwt/WSplitButton.html">WSplitButton</a>
  </dt>
  <dd>
    A split button, which combines a button and a popup menu
    (currently only styled in the Bootstrap Theme).
  </dd>

  <dt>
    <a href="eu/webtoolkit/jwt/WToolBar.html">WToolBar</a>
  </dt>
  <dd>
    A button tool bar (currently only styled in the Bootstrap Theme)
  </dd>
</dl>

<h3>B) Main improvements:</h3>

<dl>
  <dt>
    <a href="eu/webtoolkit/jwt/WDatePicker.html">WDatePicker</a>,
    <a href="eu/webtoolkit/jwt/WSuggestionPopup.html">WSuggestionPopup</a>
  </dt>
  <dd>
    The setGlobalPopup() functionality has been deprecated and does no
    longer have any effect, since a new improved algorithm is being
    used to anchor the popup to the DOM which no longer requires this
    workaround.
  </dd>

  <dt>
    <a href="eu/webtoolkit/jwt/WDialog.html">WDialog</a>
  </dt>
  <dd>
    Addition of a getFooter() method that returns a container for dialog
    footer elements, typically buttons.
  </dd>

  <dt>
    <a href="eu/webtoolkit/jwt/WFormModel.html">WFormModel</a>
  </dt>
  <dd>
    Addition of a getValidator() function that returns the validator for
    a field set using setValidator(), 
  </dd>

  <dt>
    <a href="eu/webtoolkit/jwt/WPushButton.html">WPushButton</a>
  </dt>
  <dd>
    A push button can now act as a toggle button, using setCheckable()
    and related API (currently only styled in the Bootstrap Theme) and
    can be linked to a popup menu using setMenu().
  </dd>

  <dt>
    <a href="eu/webtoolkit/jwt/WStackedWidget.html">WStackedWidget</a>
  </dt>
  <dd>
    When switching between current widgets, the stacked widget will
    now record and restore the current scroll position, providing a
    much improved user experience when using the stacked widget for
    the 'main' contents of an application.
  </dd>

  <dt>
    <a href="eu/webtoolkit/jwt/WStringListModel.html">WStringListModel</a>
  </dt>
  <dd>
    Full support was added for storing data of all roles, lifting the
    requirement to use another model such as WStandardItemModel for
    simple MVC widgets like WComboBox or WSuggestionPopup simply to be
    able to store UserRole data.
  </dd>

  <dt>
    <a href="eu/webtoolkit/jwt/WTemplate.html">WTemplate</a>
  </dt>
  <dd>
    Added a new standard function (Functions.block) which allows the
    definition and use of a macro block inside a placeholder, which is
    in particular useful for forms which have repetitive formatting
    for each field.
  </dd>

  <dt>
    <a href="eu/webtoolkit/jwt/WTemplateFormView.html">WTemplateFormView</a>
  </dt>
  <dd>
    Several API improvements: A new setFormWidget() allows the
    definition of the form widget for editing a field which
    is a more useful alternative compared to reimplement
    createFormWidget(). It also allows the optional
    definition of an interface to update the view/model values, which
    avoids the need for specializing updateViewField() and
    updateModelField() these latter two functions have been deprecated
    in favour of two new functions updateViewValue() and
    updateModelValue() which only update the value but not other
    aspects such as visibility, validation state, or messages.
  </dd>
</dl>

<h3>C) Non-backwards compatible changes</h3>

<dl>
  <dt>
    <a href="eu/webtoolkit/jwt/WMenuItem.html">WMenuItem</a>
  </dt>
  <dd>
    While in previous version of JWt, this class was only a data class
    that held the information related to an item, in 3.3.0 we modified
    this so that this class represents the widget itself. If you were
    redefining protected methods to customize the widget
    (i.e. createItemWidget() and updateItemWidget()), then this will no
    longer work as expected. The new system should be easier to
    customize (since you can simply specialize WMenuItem itself).
    In addition, we've simplified the rendering of a menu item so that
    a redundant layer of spans (or div's) has been removed. It makes
    the menu more consistent with the way CSS designers expect a menu
    to rendered, and this was done (you can guess the theme of this
    release by now ?) to be compatible with bootstrap's CSS styles.
  </dd>

  <dt>
    <a href="eu/webtoolkit/jwt/WCalendar.html">WCalendar</a>
  </dt>
  <dd>
    The markup for this class has changed, and thus customized CSS
    will need to be updated.
  </dd>

  <dt>
    <a href="eu/webtoolkit/jwt/WMenuItem.html">WPopupMenuItem</a>
  </dt>
  <dd>
    The popup menu item class has been merged with WMenuItem (and
    WPopupMenu is now a specialized WMenu). This should not have
    noticable API changes, except for the changes in markup and CSS
    documented above.
  </dd>
  
  <dt>
    <a href="eu/webtoolkit/jwt/WTreeNode.html">WTreeNode</a>,
    <a href="eu/webtoolkit/jwt/WTreeTable.html">WTreeTable</a>
    <a href="eu/webtoolkit/jwt/WTreeView.html">WTreeView</a>
  </dt>
  <dd>
    The markup for tree rendering has been changed (to using nested
    unordered list instead of nested tables), and thus customized CSS
    will need to be updated. The only API consequence is that
    WTreeNode.getLabelArea() is no longer returning a WTableCell but
    instead a WContainerWidget.
  </dd>
</dl>
<hr>

<h2>Release 3.2.3 (November 1, 2012)</h2>

<p>
  This release contains mostly bug fixes and one new feature: a payment
  processing API.
</p>

<h3>A) New classes:</h3>

<dl>
  <dt>
    <a href="eu/webtoolkit/jwt/render/package-summary.html">Render library:</a>
    a library for rendering XHTML to (e.g.) PDF.
  </dt>
  <dd>
    <p>
      This library contains an XHTML parser and layout engine. It's
      main purpose is simplifying PDF report generation. The library
      uses PDFJet for low-level PDF functions. The layout engine does
      not understand all HTML/CSS concepts, but it does a decent job
      in static layout (blocks, inline elements, tables and floats) in
      any arbitrary combination, multi-page rendering, and accurate
      use of font metrics.
    </p>
  </dd>
</dl>

<h3>B) Main improvements:</h3>

<dl>
  <dt>
    Layout improvements
  </dt>
  <dd>
    If you had massive trouble migrating to 3.2.2 because of the
    layout rewrite, then you'll appreciate the efforts we've made to
    make the layout algorithms in 3.2.3 much more robust and
    consistent.
  </dd>

</dl>

<hr>

<h2>Release 3.2.2 (July 23, 2012)</h2>

<p>
  This release contains next to the usual bug fixes, the addition of new
  functionality for authentication.
</p>

<h3>A) Main improvements:</h3>

<dl>
  <dt>
    <a href="eu/webtoolkit/jwt/WLayout.html">WBoxLayout, WGridLayout</a>
  </dt>
  <dd>
    <p>
    The layout managers have been reimplement, to address various
    issues with the old implementation, including API (in particular the wonked
    side-effects of AlignTop, AlignJustify) inconsistencies and bugs.
    </p>

    <p>The new implementation no longer uses tables when JavaScript
    is available, but instead using JavaScript-based layout with
    absolute positioning. The table-based implementation is still kept
    for plain HTML sessions (and progressive bootstrap). The code now
    uses exactly the same layout logic for both horizontal and
    vertical layout (but giving precedence to horizontal layout) and
    should be much more consistent (and perhaps also more
    performant). However, because of the many complexities and
    problems with the old code (inconsistent behaviour), you may see
    issues while upgrading. Please see the "Non-backwards compatible
    changes" below for hints on how to deal with this.</p>
  </dd>

  <dt>
    <a href="eu/webtoolkit/jwt/WAbstractItemView.html">WAbstractItemView</a>
  </dt>
  <dd>
    <p>
    A drag &amp; drop mime-type can now be specified on a per-item
    basis using a new ItemDataRole,
    and the mime-type for the entire selection is computed
    from these individual mime-types.

  </dd>

  <dt>
    <a href="eu/webtoolkit/jwt/WInteractWidget.html">WInteractWidget</a>

    MarkserScaleFactorRole was added which allows overriding the
    marker size based on item model data.

<h3>B) Non-backwards compatible changes</h3>

<dl>
  <dt>
    <a href="eu/webtoolkit/jwt/WLayout.html">WBoxLayout, WGridLayout</a>
  </dt>
  <dd>
    While migrating old code to this version, here are some tips:
    <ol>
      <li><p>Alignment flags</p>
      <p>Previously, specifying an alignment for a widget in a
      layout, or for the layout when set to a container, had a double
      meaning. Not only would it implement the given alignment but also
      revert to passively letting HTML layout decide the layout of the
      contents, and adjust the parent (layout respectively container)
      accordingly. This had all kinds of side effects such as not
      propagating the size of layout-size-aware widgets and quirks in
      the vertical alignment.</p>
      <p>WContainerWidget.setLayout(layout, alignment) has been
      deprecated and will be removed from a future release. This call
      was almost always used to let the parent container resize to fit
      the size of the contained children, instead of fitting children
      in the parent container. This behaviour is now
      automatically deduced based on an (empty) size of the parent
      container. In case this heuristic does not work, then setting a
      non-0 maximum size on the container using setMaximumSize() will
      act as a trigger, with the added benefit that the parent will only
      be allowed to resize up to a specified maximum size.</p>
      <p>An alignment specified in
      W(Box/Grid)Layout::addWidget(widget, stretch, alignment) now
      purely affects the alignment but has no other side effects. The
      perferred and minimum sizes of a child widget or layout is now
      always taken into account.</p>
      </li>
      <li><p>Child item sizes</p>
      <p>The layout algorithm is now implemented entirely in
      JavaScript, and is more gentle when dealing with a combination
      of cells (or columns/rows) that have a stretch factor and others
      that don't. Previously, a minimum (or fixed) size would be used
      to layout items that do not have a stretch factor. This had for
      example as a consequence that a WText would be narrowed down to its
      minimum width by using word wrapping throughout. Now, the
      preferred size is used for a child item, and shrinking to a minimum
      size only if necessary.</p>
      <li><p>Progressive bootstrap</p>
      A layout in the first page of an application rendered using
      progressive bootstrap will no longer fully upgrade to a full
      JavaScript version, but will result in a hybrid (between
      table-based and JavaScript-based). If it doesn't work out as you'ld
      expect, then you should reconsider the use of progressive bootstrap,
      or the use of a layout manager in your first page.
      </li>
    </ol>
