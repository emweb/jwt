/**
 * The abstract base class for a paint device.
 *
 * <p>A WPaintDevice is a device on which may be painted using a {@link WPainter}. You should never
 * paint directly on a paint device.
 *
 * <p>The device defines the size of the drawing area, using {@link WPaintDevice#getWidth()
 * getWidth()} and {@link WPaintDevice#getHeight() getHeight()}. These dimensions must be defined in
 * pixel units. In the future, additional information will be included to convert these pixel units
 * to lengths (using DPI information).
 *
 * <p>You should reimplement this class if you wish to extend the JWt paint system to paint on other
 * devices than the ones provided by the library.
 *
 * <p><i>Note: this interface is subject to changes to increase optimization possibilities for the
 * painting using different devices.</i>
 *
 * <p>
